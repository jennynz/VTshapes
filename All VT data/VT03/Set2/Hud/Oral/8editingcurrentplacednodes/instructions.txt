use this if some data points have already been placed and you simply wish to edit the current placement
make sure no new points are added and the order is maintained. (don't swap any of the nodes so the cmiss number should 
only either increase or decrease consistantly in the clock wise direction.

copy in the plane...exdata files which should be in the folder exdataforareacalculation
copy in the slices folder and curve.exnode file 

run the data_point_editor.com
edit any of the data points you wish and type in write_to_file in the cmgui command line
The new data points will be written in to the folders editedexdata and editedexnode

Be very care full with this command file
