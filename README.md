# Mappings between vocal tract area functions, vocal tract resonances and speech formants for multiple speakers

Engineering Honours thesis project by Jenny Sahng
Supervisors: Dr Catherine Watson & Dr Richard Clarke

## Project Description

There is a long-established and deterministic link between vocal tract shapes and speech formants. Early studies on formant analysis established a strong correlation between the first two formants with phonetic height and backness respectively. It is possible to also calculate vocal tract resonances from the vocal tract shapes derived from MRI images. A short study on five New Zealand English (NZE) has shown it is possible to use principal component (PC) analysis to separate the vocal tract shapes of all 11 monopthongs, and that the first two PC of the vocal tract shapes. can be directly related to the first two formants. This study aims to extends those findings by looking at two different impacts on vocal tract shape: namely aging and different accent, in this case American English (AmE). We will seek to establish a whether we can find a function that will "age" a vocal tract shape, and consequently enable us to hear the impacting of aging on the resulting speech, and additionally we seek to find a function that will transform NZE vocal tract shapes into US English one. This project will suit some one with a background in acoustic phonetics.
