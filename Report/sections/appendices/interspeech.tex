Watson's paper \cite{watson2014mappings} which was a precursor to this project analysed 5 speakers who each had 2 sets of 11 vowels processed and analysed. Hence, when the following results are compared directly against the same speaker data in our analyses of only 1 set per speaker, discrepancies do arise.
