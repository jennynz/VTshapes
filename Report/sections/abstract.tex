In this project, we validate the suitability of using area functions and resonances derived from the MRI to analyse vowels, using principal component analysis. Cross-sectional area functions are extracted from a series of saggital sections of the vocal tract, the MRI images manipulated and each cross-sectional slice manually identified on CMGUI. 

This project expanded on previous research carried out by Dr Catherine Watson, increasing the dataset from 5 speakers to 12 speakers. Comparisons are made between the combined vowel properties of speaker groups which differ in age, gender and accent.

Understanding any discrepancies allows us to improve our models of the vocal tract.
